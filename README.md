# UPPAAL_NN
We implement DeepAuto, utilizing UPPAAL model checker.

The repository contains experiments, showing the practicability of DeepAuto. extract_weights.py is designed to extract the weights of DNN, which we are interested in. Based on extracted weights, we could construct formal model of the DNN following DeepAuto algorithm.

DeepAuto workflow describes the running process of our framework.
